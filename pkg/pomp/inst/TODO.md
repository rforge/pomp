### pomp to-do list

- improve 'pmcmc' to take advantage of all particles
- documentation on 'mifList', 'pmcmcList', etc.
- 'transform' argument for pmcmc?
- 'initializer' -> 'rinit' and perhaps 'dinit'
- documentation: "regular parameters" instead of "non-IVP"
- add 'coef' method for 'mifList' objects
- objective function for spectrum matching
- one-point SCQL function for possible use in fitting initial conditions
- save particle filtering variance?  Prediction means are optional.  Only interesting for end-user if one wants to look at residuals.
- write pompCBuilder support for 'onestep.dens' and 'gillespie.sim' plugins.
- parameter transformations: put 'transform' option into each estimation routine (spect.match)
- unit tests for 'sannbox'
- partial rejection control for 'pfilter'?
- adaptive particle numbers in pfilter.
- improve 'plot' and 'print' methods for 'pfilterd.pomp' objects.  
    - Would this display effective sample size, conditional log likelihood, filter means, prediction variances, prediction means?
- Add plugin for adaptive tau leaping algorithm.
- Parallel 'pfilter' algorithm.
- Add LPA model examples.
- SDE examples.
- Extended Kalman filter.
- Plugin for compartmental models.
