- 'transform' argument for pmcmc?
- 'initializer' -> 'rinit' and perhaps 'dinit'
- 'initializer' via Csnippets?
- documentation: "regular parameters" instead of "non-IVP"
- add 'coef' method for 'mifList' objects
- objective function for spectum matching
- one-point SCQL function for possible use in fitting initial conditions
- save particle filtering variance?  Prediction means are optional.  Only interesting for end-user if one wants to look at residuals.
